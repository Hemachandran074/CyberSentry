# CyberSentry — Autonomous SOC & Threat Detection Platform CyberSentry is an agentic security operations platform. Telemetry becomes normalised events, events  become detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and detections are correlated into a small    number of incidents an analyst can actually work.

## Problem Statement
A mid-size SOC generates tens of thousands of alerts a day and closes most of them as noise. The bottleneck is not detection but correlation: the same intrusion produces a dozen alerts across endpoint, proxy and identity logs, and an analyst re-derives the connection by hand every time. CyberSentry makes correlation a first-class, deterministic stage — entity-based grouping inside a bounded time window — so the analyst receives one incident with its full detection chain rather than twelve independent alerts.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| M1 | Architecture, streaming and search infrastructure, detection schema |
| M2 | Anomaly detection and behavioural model training on normalised events |
| M3 | Detection engine with rule and model blending, ATT&CK mapping |
| M4 | Agentic triage and threat-hunting copilot with playbook reasoning |
| M5 | SOC console with incident timeline and entity graph |
| M6 | Deployment, detection-as-code CI and model drift monitoring |

## Quick Start
```bash
cp .env.example .env
make up          # start the full infrastructure stack
make db-init     # apply schema (auto-applied on first boot)
make seed        # load reference + demo data
make verify      # M1 acceptance checks
```

## Repository Layout
- `libs/sentry_domain/` — pure severity and correlation logic
- `services/` — one container per agent
- `scripts/` — schema, topic and index creation, dataset ETL, seeding, verification
- `config/` — topics, detection rules and the OpenSearch index template
- `docs/adr/` — architecture decision records

## Tech Stack
- **Kafka** — Telemetry event bus — raw, normalised and detection topics
- **Zookeeper** — Kafka coordination (single-node dev mode)
- **OpenSearch** — Full-text and time-range search over normalised events
- **PostgreSQL** — Assets, rules, incidents and response actions — the case state
- **Redis** — Deduplication windows and enrichment cache
- **MLflow** — Anomaly and classification model tracking from M2

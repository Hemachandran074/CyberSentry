# ADR-0002: Correlation is deterministic, not learned

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-09-11

## Context

An analyst must be able to explain why twelve alerts became one incident. A learned grouping that cannot be justified turns into a trust problem during an actual intrusion, which is the worst possible moment.

## Decision

`libs/sentry_domain/correlation.py` groups detections by shared entity (host, user, source IP, process lineage) within a configurable time window, using a stable dedup key. Models may raise or lower a detection's score but never decide grouping.

## Consequences

+ Every incident's membership is explainable and reproducible.
+ Replaying a day of detections rebuilds the same incidents.
- Sophisticated low-and-slow campaigns spanning the window need explicit hunting rather than automatic grouping.

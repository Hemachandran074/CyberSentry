# ADR-0001: Two stores: OpenSearch for telemetry, PostgreSQL for case state

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-09-11

## Context

Telemetry search needs inverted indexes and time-partitioned shards. Incident workflow needs transactions, foreign keys and frequent small updates. One engine doing both does each badly.

## Decision

Normalised events are indexed in OpenSearch with daily indices and an ISM policy. Assets, rules, detections, incidents and response actions live in PostgreSQL. A detection row stores the OpenSearch document id, so drilling from incident to raw evidence is one lookup.

## Consequences

+ Each store runs the workload it is designed for.
+ Telemetry retention is tuned independently of case retention.
- Two systems to operate and keep consistent.
- Cross-store joins must happen in the application layer.
